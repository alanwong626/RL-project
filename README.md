Reinforcement Learning Group Project: Dino Run RL

Training an agent to play the Chrome offline dino run game, using a deep Q-learning techniques.

Update 14/4:
Agent is now learning and the output of the training is logged into a csv file.
To do:
1) Refactor and modularize the code
2) Include a jupyter notebook for data visualization
3) Upload environment
4) Update instructions


Update 03/4:
Code up and running, but the learning performance is undesirable...
To do:
1) Find the bug or error in the code
